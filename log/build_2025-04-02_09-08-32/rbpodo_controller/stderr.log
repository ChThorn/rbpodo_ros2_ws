  By not providing "Findrbpodo_hardware.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rbpodo_hardware", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rbpodo_hardware"
  with any of the following names:

    rbpodo_hardwareConfig.cmake
    rbpodo_hardware-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rbpodo_hardware" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "rbpodo_hardware_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "rbpodo_hardware" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
